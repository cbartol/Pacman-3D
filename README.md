Pacman-3D
=========

This is a simple pacman game that my group made for a school project.
It was programmed in C++ and we used OpenGL API.


How to run:

(OpenGL API is required (GL/glut.h))

At 'src' folder there is a Makefile.

To compile --> make all

To clean   --> make clean

After compilation run --> ./pacman

Notes:
- It was developed in the UNIX system (but I think it can run on windows).
- There may be some unknown bugs but in general everything works.
- We were lazy and had other projects so we didn't comment our code, and any comment lost in code may be in Portuguese.
